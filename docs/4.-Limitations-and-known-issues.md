# Limitations and known issues

* When the CleanSession is set to `false`, the implementation is not spec compliant. The following is not honored:

> Must be kept in memory:
* All messages in a QoS 1 or 2 flow, which are not confirmed by the broker
* All received QoS 2 messages, which are not yet confirmed to the broker

This means retransmission is not honored in case of a failure.

* You cannot send payload larger that what can fit on RAM.
* SSL is not doable at the moment.
